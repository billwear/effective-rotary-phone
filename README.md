   [e]ffective [r]otary [p]hone - calls up data from bsd-calendar-like file

   command line options:

      -d designator  show items of type [designator] (see below)

      -s tag         show only items containing [tag]
      
      -f phonebook   load [phonebook] instead of ~/.phonebook

      -t todofile    print output to [todofile] in a format compatible with
                     todo.txt apps using the due: and t: (threshold) notations

      -v             verbose output

      -h             print this usage message and exit

   phonebook structure:

      designator\\tinformation (lines without a tab are ignored)

   where [designator] is one of the following:
   
      name   someone's contact information
      [date] a date in one of the formats described below
      note   a note to keep & call up later
      todo   a to-do item

   date formats:

      yyyymmdd a specific date; substituting dashes for a digit has the
               effect of ignoring that part of the date (allowing repeats);
               for example, 0000mmdd = annual; 000000dd = ddth day of each month;
               00000000 matches every day of the year, but "daily" is easier.

      daily    every day of the year

      mon      name of any day; only looks at first three letters of the day.

      Nmon     Nth day of every month (eg, Nth monday); only looks at first
               three letters of the day; nonsense numbers (10) won't match.

      Nmon oct Nth day of given month; month can be string or number, only matches
               first three letters of a string; nonsense month won't match.

      weekday  every monday through friday; holidays not considered, so ymmv.

      weekend  every saturday and sunday.

      Nweekend Nth weekend of every month; nonsense numbers won't match.

   todo.txt output structure:

      the todo.txt output uses the +project, due: and t: meta-elements to encode
      erp items. [name] and [note] items are marked with [+name] or [+note], 
		respectively.  [todo] items are simply passed through with no changes.
      Dated items are passed through with "due:" and "t:" items set to today.
      Any todo.txt information in the line is treated as plain text and passed on;
      for example, if an erp line has [+cleangarage] in it, that will be passed to
      the todo.txt file as is, and presumably recognized as a project by the todo app.
